# Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wiper
Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wiper using Arduino, Rain Sensor and Servo motor  <br>
```This project uses an Arduino, a Rain Sensor, and a Servo Motor to create an automatic wiper system for vehicles. When the rain sensor detects water droplets, the Arduino triggers the servo motor to activate the wiper mechanism automatically. This system simulates how modern cars respond to rain without manual control, enhancing driver safety and convenience```
